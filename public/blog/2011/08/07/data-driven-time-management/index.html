<div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><strong>Laziness</strong>: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<p />
<div>In keeping with Larry Wall&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="http://threevirtues.com/" target="_blank">virtues of a programmer</a>, I seek to be as lazy as possible while still&nbsp;achieving&nbsp;my goals. Working smarter, not harder, is fundamental in every program I write - shouldn&#8217;t it be fundamental in how I behave? My deepest fear is working incredibly hard on something that creates no value or helps no one at all. At the end of the day, am I tired because I changed the world, or because I developed carpal tunnel syndrome refreshing my Facebook feed?</div>
<div>
<div>
<p />
<div>I&#8217;m employed full-time at <a href="http://paperlesspost.com">Paperless Post</a>, where I work across teams on a wide variety of projects. I spend evenings and weekends running&nbsp;<a href="http://girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a>, organizing <a href="http://meetup.developersforgood.org">Developers for Good</a>, and advising <a href="http://hirelite.com">Hirelite</a>. I also exercise and watch teen dance movies of low artistic caliber regularly and eat dessert every day.</div>
<div>
<p />
<div>Simply put, I work a lot and I get a lot done. Despite that productivity, I recently found myself unable to keep up with even important emails, and on edge about relationships that might not use my time effectively. I&#8217;m familiar with techniques like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> and <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro</a>, but I hesitate to adopt any entirely new method without fully understanding what could be improved about my own.</div>
</div>
<p />
<div>So, in an effort to understand my time&#8217;s ROI, I turned to data. I tried several time-tracking tools for a couple of hours each on a Sunday while I did remote volunteer work. The free tool that was easiest to use and gave me the most freedom in analyzing my information was <a href="http://bit.ly/rBQs2s" title="Toggl.com">Toggl</a>. Thanks to web, desktop, and mobile apps, I was able to bring time tracking into all aspects of my life.</div>
<p />
<div>I have a workspace for each significant obligation in my life - e.g. Paperless Post, Girl Develop It, Developers for Good &amp; Volunteering, Personal. I use Projects to track the type of work I&#8217;m doing - e.g. Analytics, DBA, Product, Finance, Admin, Relaxation. I track&nbsp;significant&nbsp;emails or questions I answer, what I&#8217;m debugging, coding, or fixing, how long my meetings, calls, and <a href="http://ohours.org/DBNess">Ohours</a>&nbsp;take, and just about everything else.&nbsp;When I change windows on my desktop and may be off-task, the Auto-pilot Toggl app sweetly asks&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">&#8220;WTF are you doing?&#8221;</span> &#8230; &#8220;Click to change project&#8221;, making it easy to stay honest.</div>
<p />
<div>From this meticulous data collection, I&#8217;ve learned a few things about productivity:</div>
<p />
<p />
<div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">You can&#8217;t manage what you don&#8217;t measure.</span></strong></div>
<p />
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">I recently had the feeling that I was doing way too much X and not enough Y, and I was not amused. Every time an X task came up, I developed a wrinkle. After one week of time tracking, I saw I really was doing a ton of X. I felt validated. I was less emotional about the problem, and in the next week, I also gave myself freedom to delay or delegate many X tasks in pursuit of Y tasks. I&#8217;m working with my team to better manage X tasks and in the meantime, I&#8217;m more efficient and feel in control of them. I&nbsp;have irrefutable evidence about just how demanding X work is. As we try different solutions, we&#8217;ll also know exactly how much they help.</div>
<p />
<div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Good data (tracking time as you go) is extremely important.</span></strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Your planning estimates and guesses afterward will always be wrong, and good data is fundamental to any data-driven decision making. If you think you&#8217;re good at these estimates, test yourself. Then email me how hilariously wrong you were, and we&#8217;ll chuckle.</div>
<div>
<p />
<p />
<div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Tracking time increases focus and limits context switching.</strong></span></div>
<div>
<ul>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Tracking your time makes you more aware of what you&#8217;re specifically trying to accomplish, so you&#8217;re less likely to abandon one task for another.&nbsp;Maybe you only actually get to work 25 hours out of the 40 hours you&#8217;re at a work. If you need to track what you&#8217;re doing, you&#8217;ll feel compelled to make use of dead time you might have spent doing the worst kind of context switching - pretending to multitask.</div>
</div>
<p />
<div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Time is your biggest asset. Knowing where it goes benefits you more than anyone else.</span></strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">I think a strong component of this experiment&#8217;s success has been that I&#8217;m doing it for myself. I have the freedom to show others the summary or the breakdown of my time if I&#8217;d like, but this isn&#8217;t a report that goes directly to my boss or determines my paycheck. I have the freedom to be completely honest. My priority is clean, accurate data and a true reflection of how I spend time, not convincing some other person that I&#8217;m working a lot.</div>
<p />
<p />
<div>Overall, I&#8217;ve found time tracking incredibly helpful for my focus and in helping me determine which time investments are worthwhile. I&#8217;ve also noticed trends in behavior that I&#8217;ve discussed with coworkers so we can work together to boost productivity.</div>
<p />
<div>What methods do you use to get things done? How do gauge your own effectiveness? Do your methods work for both short and long-term improvement?</div>
<p />
<p />
<div><span style="font-size: small; color: #808080;"><em>Notes:</em></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small; color: #808080;"><em>One of the reasons I chose <a href="http://bit.ly/rBQs2s" title="Toggl.com">Toggl</a>&nbsp;was for their completely free basic features plan. Most other services were unpleasant to use, less functional, or only offered a 30-day free trial, which I knew from experience might not be enough time. Call me old-fashioned, but I just can&#8217;t commit to something in every aspect of my life when it&#8217;s&nbsp;guaranteed&nbsp;to dump me in a month.</em></span></div>
