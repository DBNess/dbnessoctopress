<div class="entry-content"><div style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 8px;">
<p>So I finally got around to reading Jessica Livingston&#8217;s&nbsp;<em>Founders At Work:&nbsp;Stories of Startups&#8217; Early Days</em>. In trying to glean more from my reading (considering every third book I read is in the young adult or vampire genre, let&#8217;s be honest) - I&#8217;ve taken notes on the trends I noticed in these interviews.</p>
<p />
<div>Founders tend to have two different profiles- Product Pioneers and Business Beacons. I hope I come up with less corny names by the time I give this up to the interwebs. Founder teams don&#8217;t necessarily need one or the other, but they reflect two very different reasons people start businesses and doubtlessly affect why and how they succeed.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Product / Push / Problem / Method</strong>: focused on a particular problem and/or particular solution, dedicated to fixing the problem and willing to make money on it/ willing to make a business in order to scale the solution</div>
<div><strong>Business / Pull / Results</strong>: focused on addressing or creating a market, guiding a team to solve any problem that needs solving, making money wherever it is to be made, allowing customers to decide how the team&#8217;s resources should be spent and what&#8217;s worth making</div>
<p />
<div>Hypothesis: -some industries more flexible for pioneers</div>
<div>-what makes a pioneer successful is a great idea, domain expertise, ability to focus &amp; build, great team member</div>
<div>-what makes a business beacon successful is drive, customer development (link to Steve Blank&#8217;s blog), flexibility, and ability to drive a team</div>
<p />
<div><strong>PayPal</strong>&nbsp;- Max Levchin and Peter Thiel were both Business Beacons, though Max was gifted in crypto and started wanting to let those skills guide the business. They even got funding for a Palm Pilot beam-me-money-at-lunch concept and turned into a web-based transaction system after they realized that&#8217;s where the business was. They had certian ideas and talents, but ultimately they used them to fix the business problem at hand and followed their user base to build the business - they weren&#8217;t 100% product focused.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Hotmail</strong>&nbsp;- Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith wanted to start a business together because they were tech savvy at the dawn of the internet and they were bored with their day jobs. So they obviously thought they were bringing something to the table, but the initial impulse that got them together and started was the boredom and the drive to contribute to the exciting new age of the internet. They started with a web-based document storage system called JavaSoft and kept the Hotmail concept under wraps for a while, but Bhatia always had an affinity for business models and really wanted to use his tech knowledge to solve everyone&#8217;s problem. Email was a great idea, but e-mail wasn&#8217;t Bhatia&#8217;s passion - a big internet business was.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Apple</strong>&nbsp;- Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak<br />Jobs routinely asked Wozniak to start a company each time the two had an idea - clearly a Business Beacon, he did the business development and basically took care of everything</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Excite&nbsp;</strong>- Joe Kraus and five Stanford classmates (Graham Spencer)</div>
<div>Business Beacons:&nbsp;&#8220;We decided to start a company together before we had any idea what we were going to work on. But we were so committed to the idea of starting something together that we knew we were going to figure it out.&#8221;</div>
<div>&#8220;I kind of determined &#8230; that my life wasn&#8217;t going to be about being in an office, working with people I didn&#8217;t want to work with and doing jobs I didn&#8217;t want to do.&#8221;</div>
<div>Company slogan: &#8220;We are unencumbered by reality&#8221;</div>
<div>&#8220;We came together to start a company before even knowing what that company was doing. We were more committed to the idea of starting something together and figuring it out than a bunch of people who were only personally interested in how much money they could make or what could be built around a particular idea.&#8221;</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Software Arts</strong>&nbsp;- Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston</div>
<div>Both had entrepreneur parents and felt starting a business was &#8220;a normal thing&#8221; that they&#8217;d certainly do once they found an idea. They got the idea talking to Personal Software salesperson who was looking for a financial calculation and checkbook tool.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Lotus</strong>&nbsp;- Mitchell Kapor</div>
<div>Mitch sought to be his own boss and to make money so he wouldn&#8217;t be dependent on anyone else, but he was really just a strong-willed and value-driven Product guy. He&nbsp;had an attitude at Personal Software so he wanted to build a culture that responded to how employees felt and at one point tied manager&#8217;s bonuses to how well they&nbsp;exemplified&nbsp;the core values.</div>
<p />
<div>&#8220;I actually wanted to be a software designer. I saw having a company not exactly as being a necessary evil, but there wasn&#8217;t a good alternative.&#8221;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&#8220;While Lotus was getting started, I just saw it as a vehicle to doing great product. I never wanted to have a big company.&#8221;</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Iris Associates / Groove Networks</strong>&nbsp;- Ray Ozzie</div>
<p />
<p />
<div><strong>Fog Creek Software</strong>&nbsp;- Joel Spolsky and Michael Pryor</div>
<div>Joel wanted to start a software business about doing things the right way - they were more focused on the method than the particular problems they&#8217;d work to solve. Sounds like they&#8217;re both Product folks.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>SixApart</strong>&nbsp;- Mena and Ben Trott&nbsp;</div>
<div>Mena was a blogger who wanted better blogging software and Steve helped her build that software. The fans and downloading and growth of the business was all a means to an end - solve the blogging problem in a great way, in a way that they and others like them could benefit. This is a clear Product (/Service if you will) focus - they weren&#8217;t looking to grow a business and in fact, were even uneasy about the whole thing even when they realized they should start looking for money.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Facebook</strong>&nbsp;- Mark Zuckerburg</div>
<div>Mark&#8217;s all product - built facebook in his dorm room and carved a niche in social networking that just wasn&#8217;t there before because he did it so well. The business idea was around (six degrees) but the implementation and organic growth were vital and not about someone&nbsp;desperate&nbsp;to make any business. Some might argue this motivation has changed over time with the success of the company, but certainly Product is what got it started.</div>
