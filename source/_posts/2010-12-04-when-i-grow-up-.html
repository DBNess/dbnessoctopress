title: When I Grow Up...

<p>My family likes to tease me about Ceremonies - Graduations, Girl Scout or Boy Scout Awards, School Assemblies, you name it - I tear up. These pivotal points are so ripe with potential they bring me to tears every time. I can't think of anything more beautiful than the fusion of accomplishment and raw potential for new endeavors. Earlier, you couldn't quite justify where you were or why you were there - a credential helps with that. Later, you might not have as much time or freedom or ambition to embark on new challenges. Now is the time! Get over your years of "paying dues" and following a path because someone said it might get you where you might want to be in 5 to 10 or even 40 years and start doing what you're made for right now.</p>
