<p>On December 7, 2010 I had the honor of speaking at a local TEDx event, TEDx 636 Eleventh Ave, organized around the TED Women conference in DC. I spoke briefly about my path to becoming a computer programmer. I wish I'd known earlier what incredible potential for impact careers in technology hold. I hope more women and men, young and old, throw away preconceptions and approach programming as a way of impacting humanity.</p>
