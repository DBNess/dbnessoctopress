<p><a href="http://code.org" title="Code.org">Code.org</a>&nbsp;just launched with the vision that <strong>every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn how to code</strong>&nbsp;as well as a film encouraging every student to do so.</p>
<p>I'm grateful to have contributed to this inspiring short film by Lesley Chilcott, producer of <em><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Waiting for Superman</span></em>, alongside Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, <a href="http://bronwengrimes.com/" title="Bronwen Grimes" target="_blank">Bronwen Grimes</a>, Chris Bosh, Will.I.Am, <a href="http://silenok.com" title="Elena Silenok" target="_blank">Elena Silenok</a>, Jack Dorsey, Drew Houston, Ruchi Sanghvi, and other oustanding people.</p>
<p>If you're a teacher, know a teacher, sit next to a teacher on the subway, or otherwise have means to spread the word, please do so! No one is too old or too... anything, really, to learn how to code.&nbsp;There are several lengths and versions of <a href="http://www.code.org/teach" title="Code.org Teaching Videos" target="_blank">the film available</a>, and you can start <a href="http://code.org/learn" title="Learn to Code" target="_blank">learning to code</a> right away.</p>
<p>Once you're ready, we'll be thrilled to have you improve the world by contributing to social good coding projects at&nbsp;<a href="http://codemontage.com" title="CodeMontage: Improve your skills while improving the world" target="_blank">CodeMontage</a>.</p>
