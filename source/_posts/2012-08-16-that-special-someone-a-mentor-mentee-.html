<p>They say when you find the right person you just <em>know</em>.</p>
<p>Why do we embrace this notion for love and friend relationships, but create our most pivotal career relationships from job titles or at best, text-based inventories of skills? Mentoring is about so much more than a discrete transfer of skills - it's about sharing the real failures and successes we inevitably encounter in our professional lives.</p>
<p>I'm grateful to have mentored as a technical lead, founder, and girl scout. I've had excellent short and long-term mentors and I've also connected with "mentors" who I wasn't sure what to talk about with next. I've seen mentoring relationships between people of all ages and from casual to corporate environments and noticed a few common factors of success.</p>
<div>All relationships need a strong foundation, and mentoring is no different. The key components of a strong mentoring pair are:<em>&nbsp;</em></div>
<p><strong>Chemistry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have to straight up like each other.&nbsp;Mentors must genuinely care about their mentees as individuals so they will share time and experiences openly, without resentment.&nbsp;Mentees must feel a strong enough connection to overcome the discomfort of asking tough questions and to internalize the mentor's advice.</li>
<li>Corporate mentoring programs tend to match purely based on divisions or job ranks, and their programs are valuable for networking, but rarely as effective as matches with an emotional bond.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shared Values</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing similar life values makes it more likely you'll be comfortable with similar tactics for dealing with problems, and that you'll both listen to each other.<br /> <span style=""> </span>For example - I believe strongly in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_culture_movement" target="_blank"><span>free culture movement</span></a>. It would be hard for me to take the advice of a technical mentor who believed in technology that strongly limits use in order to protect copyright holders, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management" target="_blank"><span>DRM</span></a>. Without a strong basis of shared values, the depth of our relationship and ability to explore solutions together would be limited. I also might snarl at them, which could compromise our chemistry.</li>
<li>Communities (vs. corporations) often spawn excellent mentoring relationships, even if they don't deliberately facilitate, because of the strength of shared values among members.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transparent Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both mentors and mentees must articulate and share their goals. Otherwise, you're just hanging out.</li>
<li>At the end of a session, and routinely during the active mentoring relationship, both sides should be able to ask "did you get what you hoped for out of this?".</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've developed a relationship with someone you can learn from or share your knowledge with, the details of when, how, and how often suddenly don't seem like such a chore. You'll be free to focus on sharing and improving through mentorship.</p>
