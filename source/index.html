<p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
<p>I currently live in New York City, where I help developers improve their skills while improving the world through <a title="CodeMontage" href="http://codemontage.com" target="_blank">CodeMontage</a>. I also founded and run <a title="Developers for Good" href="http://developersforgood.org" target="_blank">Developers for Good</a>.</p>
<p>I'd like to see more people learning to code, so I co-founded <a title="Girl Develop It" href="http://girldevelopit.com" target="_blank">Girl Develop It</a>&nbsp;to provide judgment-free, low-cost environments to learn about software development.&nbsp;I previously led data and analytics for&nbsp;<a title="Paperless Post" href="http://paperlesspost.com" target="_blank">Paperless Post</a>.</p>
<p>I am interested in <a href="http://vanessahurst.com/pages/talks" target="_blank">speaking</a>&nbsp;to help make data, analytics, open source software, and technology in general more accessible. I'd also love <a href="mailto:hello@ovationlab.com?subject=I+really+appreciate..." target="_blank">to hear</a>&nbsp;about anything you really, really appreciate in life.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out via&nbsp;<a href="http://ohours.org/DBNess">Ohours</a>,&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/dbness" target="_blank">@DBNess</a>,&nbsp;or <a href="mailto:vanessa@developersforgood.org" target="_blank">email</a>.</p>
