<p>During the national TED Women conference in December 2010, I was lucky to be in the good company of fellow live speakers and supporters at TEDx 636 Eleventh Ave in NYC. Every speaker makes themselves vulnerable giving a talk like that, particularly with no topic guidance and no particular requirements, and I have so much respect for every one who participated both locally and nationally. Among speakers and attendees at our TEDx event, everyone was willing to share real stories and honest moments that were positively invigorating. After our live speaker session ended, we watched the broadcast from DC.</p>
<p>The first TEDWomen talk was from Hanna Rosin, the author of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-end-of-men/8135/" target="_blank">The End of Men</a>. She talked about the growth of women in higher education and highly skilled professional fields and how people at fertility clinics are requesting girls now when boys used to be the top choice for parents. She basically proposes that women are taking over the world and we should all acknowledge that and deal with it instead of being overwhelmed or otherwise victimized by the change.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but feel upset - maybe with certain pointed questions and carefully selected data the idea is plausible, but it's just not reality in the world I live and work in. As a technologist, most of my friends, colleagues, and role models are men. I don't like the idea of telling them to face up and prepare for domination. I see the charts she presents, but I know the charts that matter to my community - in brief, those that represent women studying computer science - are not climbing.&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.vanessahurst.com/women-in-tech-the-opportunity" target="_blank">They're falling</a>. I can't help but think her whole position undermines what I hope for by representing a reality totally different from ours. After a day of feeling pretty validated in my story and my goals, I felt defeated by the talk. It's daunting to think that in some parts of society, women and men might think that nonsensical gender gaps have disappeared or are no longer worth addressing. It's just so far from the truth out here in the field.</p>
<p>I left the TEDx event both inspired and challenged, having met some truly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iCdzZplu-Y" title="&quot;Good Morning&quot; by Emily May of Hollaback!" target="_blank">amazing</a> <a href="http://daretodream.typepad.com" title="Whitney Johnson's Dare to Dream Blog" target="_blank">people</a>. I'm resolved that whatever cultural theories might surface, there's still a lot of progress to be made in inspiring young women and more young men&nbsp;toward&nbsp;technical careers and innovation.</p>
