<p>November is one of my favorite months because everyone becomes obsessed with two of my longtime favorite things: food and gratitude. If it weren&#8217;t for the creepy mustaches of <a href="http://www.movember.com/" title="Movember: the creepiest possible way to spread the word about Prostate Cancer" target="_blank">Movember</a>, November might even triumph as the best month of the year.</p>
<p>'Stache dilemma aside, I try to express gratitude regularly for three main reasons:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Acknowledgement</strong> - Life is beautiful and all of us, especially those who can read and freely share ideas through the internet, have a lot to be grateful for.</li>
    <li><strong>Happiness</strong> - It makes us happy to acknowledge the people, places, and things that make our lives better, according to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHv6vTKD6lg" title="Science of Gratitude (Video)" target="_blank">science</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Future Happiness</strong> - <span>When we know what really makes us happy (aka what weâ€™re grateful for), we can better prioritize our lives.</span></li>
  </ol>
<p>I have a few tricks for reminding myself to express gratitude, including a thrice daily gratitude journal prompt from <a href="http://grateful160.com" title="grateful160 | Gratitude Journal" target="_blank">grateful160</a> and browsing <a href="http://www.paperlesspost.com/cards/group/stationery_thank_you_notes" title="Thank You Notes on Paperless Post" target="_blank">thank you cards on Paperless Post</a>. What works for you? Do you think gratitude is important? I&#8217;d love to hear why or why not.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
