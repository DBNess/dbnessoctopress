  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yields 1 Technology-powered Social Entrepreneur<p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type: none; text-indent: 40px;">
  <li>1 Girl Scout, pre-formed by </li>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none; text-indent: 40px;">
  	  <li>1 U.S. Marine Corps Officer & Cultural Anthropologist</li>
      <li>1 Book Fair Expert & Math Lover</li>
  </ul>
  <li>1 Promise to Make the World a Better Place</li>
  <li>5 U.S. States</li>
  <li>9 Public Schools</li>
  <li>10 Girl Scout Troops</li>
  <li>1 Pre-med/Biomedical Engineering major</li>
  <li>3 Credits Computer Science 101 class</li>
  <li>1 Computer Science degree</li>
  <li>100 TB Financial Data</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<p>Mix Girl Scout, Promise, and dreams of making the world a better place in each of 5 states, 9 public schools, and 10 scout troops. After 17 years, add Pre-med/Biomedical Engineering major and Computer Science 101 class to yield Computer Science major. Four years later, add Computer Science degree and see Girl Scout grow to New York City. Add 100 TB Financial Data to establish Database Administrator expertise. Let Promise to help people at all times simmer. Girl Scout will form <a href="http://developersforgood.org">Developers for Good</a> and connect 700+ technologists with social impact organizations.</p>

<p>After years of being one of few women in the room, introduce Girl Scout to women who are interested in technology, but think it&#8217;s too late to learn to code. Girl Scout will form <a href="http://girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a> to teach low-cost, judgment-free software development courses. After three years of mixing, teaching, and organizing operations, Girl Develop It will expand to 16 chapters worldwide, over 4,000 students, and a community of 30,000 learners.</p>

<p>As the U.S. Bureau of Labor & Statistics reports we&#8217;ll have 1 million unfilled software jobs by 2018, mix Girl Scout with film producer of Waiting for Superman and other technical leaders to launch <a href="http://code.org">Code.org</a> film, &#8221;<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=nKIu9yen5nc">What most schools don&#8217;t teach</a>.&#8221; Finally, as Developers for Good and Girl Develop It and Code.org evolve, Girl Scout will produce <a href="http://codemontage.com">CodeMontage</a> to help people become better software engineers while improving the world.</p>

<h3>Results:</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type: none; text-indent: 40px;">
  <li>700 Developers for Good</li>
  <li>30,000 Girl Develop It community members</li>
  <li>16 million+ Code.org &#8220;What Most Schools Don&#8217;t Teach&#8221; views</li>
  <li>40 CodeMontage Open Source Social Impact Projects</li>
  <li>1 Social Entrepreneur, just getting started on changing the world</li>
</ul></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In typical developer style, I just spent several hours hacking on something only to find a totally different way to accomplish the same thing in about ten minutes.</p>
<p>The short version of setting up ThinkUp app was pretty phenomenally easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a free account with a free plan on <a href="http://appfog.com" title="AppFog" target="_blank">AppFog</a></li>
<li>Use Launcher.io&#8217;s <a href="https://launcher.io/ThinkUp" title="Launcher.io ThinkUp" target="_blank">ThinkUp Jumpstart one-click install</a> (golden!) to deploy to AppFog</li>
<li>Upgrade ThinkUp as prompted in your navigation bar</li>
<li>Update Settings &gt; Account &gt; Enable beta upgrades so you can get the <a href="http://blog.thinkup.com/post/39497204010/thinkup-2-0-getting-better" title="Thinkup 2.0 Beta" target="_blank">snazzy 2.0 beta</a></li>
<li>Upgrade ThinkUp as prompted in your navigation bar (again)</li>
<li>Add social media accounts in the plugins section</li>
<li>Clear your browser&#8217;s cache</li>
<li>Rock and roll</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m intrigued by ThinkUp for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/ginatrapani/thinkup" title="Think Up" target="_blank">open source</a>!</li>
<li>It has a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/thinkupapp" title="ThinkUp community" target="_blank">community that first identifies itself as friendly</a></li>
<li>It has analytics! based on data!</li>
<li>Its core codebase was written by one of my favorite developer-founders, <a href="http://ginatrapani.org/" title="Gina Trapani" target="_blank">Gina Trapani</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dashes.com" title="Anil Dash" target="_blank">Anil Dash</a>,&nbsp;Gina&#8217;s co-founder,&nbsp;is one of the best twitter users I know (seriously, did you see <a href="http://twitter.com/anildash/status/275055322102636544" title="High Five Fist Bump" target="_blank">this tweet</a>?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking forward to seeing how this goes :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>They say when you find the right person you just <em>know</em>.</p>
<p>Why do we embrace this notion for love and friend relationships, but create our most pivotal career relationships from job titles or at best, text-based inventories of skills? Mentoring is about so much more than a discrete transfer of skills - it&#8217;s about sharing the real failures and successes we inevitably encounter in our professional lives.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m grateful to have mentored as a technical lead, founder, and girl scout. I&#8217;ve had excellent short and long-term mentors and I&#8217;ve also connected with &#8220;mentors&#8221; who I wasn&#8217;t sure what to talk about with next. I&#8217;ve seen mentoring relationships between people of all ages and from casual to corporate environments and noticed a few common factors of success.</p>
<div>All relationships need a strong foundation, and mentoring is no different. The key components of a strong mentoring pair are:<em>&nbsp;</em></div>
<p><strong>Chemistry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have to straight up like each other.&nbsp;Mentors must genuinely care about their mentees as individuals so they will share time and experiences openly, without resentment.&nbsp;Mentees must feel a strong enough connection to overcome the discomfort of asking tough questions and to internalize the mentor&#8217;s advice.</li>
<li>Corporate mentoring programs tend to match purely based on divisions or job ranks, and their programs are valuable for networking, but rarely as effective as matches with an emotional bond.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shared Values</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing similar life values makes it more likely you&#8217;ll be comfortable with similar tactics for dealing with problems, and that you&#8217;ll both listen to each other.<br /> <span style=""> </span>For example - I believe strongly in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_culture_movement" target="_blank"><span>free culture movement</span></a>. It would be hard for me to take the advice of a technical mentor who believed in technology that strongly limits use in order to protect copyright holders, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management" target="_blank"><span>DRM</span></a>. Without a strong basis of shared values, the depth of our relationship and ability to explore solutions together would be limited. I also might snarl at them, which could compromise our chemistry.</li>
<li>Communities (vs. corporations) often spawn excellent mentoring relationships, even if they don&#8217;t deliberately facilitate, because of the strength of shared values among members.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transparent Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both mentors and mentees must articulate and share their goals. Otherwise, you&#8217;re just hanging out.</li>
<li>At the end of a session, and routinely during the active mentoring relationship, both sides should be able to ask &#8220;did you get what you hoped for out of this?&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve developed a relationship with someone you can learn from or share your knowledge with, the details of when, how, and how often suddenly don&#8217;t seem like such a chore. You&#8217;ll be free to focus on sharing and improving through mentorship.</p>
<p>Ready to mentor? Reach out to your communities and join the&nbsp;<a href="http://ohours.org/topics/mentoring" target="_blank">mentoring</a>&nbsp;topic on&nbsp;<a href="http://ohours.org/mentoring" target="_blank">Ohours</a>*, which has additional&nbsp;<a href="http://ohours.org/mentoring" target="_blank">tips for mentoring</a>.</p>
<p>*Note: I&#8217;m an advisor and&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">obsessive</span>&nbsp;avid user of&nbsp;<a href="http://ohours.org/" target="_blank">Ohours</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I push an omelet around on my plate as I try to explain to my mentor what&#8217;s holding me back on a project. It comes down to embarrassment - sometimes I&#8217;m so deeply afraid of being embarrassed, I don&#8217;t even try. My mentor has the perfect cure: she tells me the most embarrassing situation she can remember. Think Lost meets Jerry Springer, startup-style. Her story is messy. And exactly what I need to hear. My thoughts shift - This amazing person is human! If she can make real mistakes and still be so wonderful, maybe there&#8217;s a chance for me after all!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been lucky to mentor, be mentored, co-mentor, and generally just talk about work with a lot of great people in various settings. Here are a few keys to success I&#8217;ve noticed for both mentors and mentees.</p>
<p><strong>What Awesome Mentors Do</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>Tell it like it is</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Give real, personal, unfiltered insight on what a job, company, or project was really like. Not the &#8220;we used analytics and made improvements&#8221; excerpts from the company press release, but the &#8220;I almost punched him in the face and stormed out&#8221; moments your mentee can only learn about from a real person - you.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Add perspective</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Think outside the box to help your mentee achieve goals or gain insight on a problem. Mentors usually have technical knowledge or experience that puts them in a position to help, even if just by planting the seed of an idea.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Advocate</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Advocate for your mentee, both directly (if they suffer from&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank"><span>impostor syndrome</span></a>) and to others within the organization, company, or community. Remember, your mentee doesn&#8217;t know your entire network, so you&#8217;ll need to think of who can help your mentee rather than waiting for an introduction request.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Set Expectations</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Let your mentee know what you do and don&#8217;t want to talk about, how often you&#8217;d like to be contacted, and through which channels. There&#8217;s no wrong answer to this, and it helps them get comfortable within your parameters so you both can get the most out of the relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Listen</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Articulating how things are going to someone they respect who&#8217;s not their boss can be really meaningful for a mentee. Don&#8217;t think you need to talk the whole time to provide value.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>What Awesome Mentees Do</strong></p>
<p><em>Make meeting easy</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Use<span>&nbsp;<a href="http://ohours.org/" target="_blank"><span>Ohours</span></a></span>* or another tool to limit time spent on back-and-forth scheduling.</li>
<li>Send calendar invitations and polite reminders before meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Articulate goals</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Write down what you hope to accomplish - what&#8217;s going on that you want to bring up?</li>
<li>What interesting experience have you been hoping to hear more about from your mentor?</li>
<li>Email with your mentor in advance of your session to share specifics if you can (though it&#8217;s always okay to bring something else up).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Make follow-up easy</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Take notes and remind mentors of connections they&#8217;d like to make, that book they forgot the name of but think you&#8217;d love, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The keys to mentoring are ultimately simple- be genuine, and share your experiences and your goals. Mentoring relationships come in all frequencies (weekly or a few times a year), mediums (video chat or brunch), and arenas (developing specific skills or seeking a promotion). It&#8217;s up to you to <a href="http://vanessahurst.com/finding-that-special-someone-a-mentor-mentee">find a great match</a> and get the most out of the relationship.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First and foremost, Congratulations to&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/yokolet">Yoko Harada</a>, one of this year&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="http://rubyheroes.com/">Ruby Heroes</a>! She&#8217;s made substantial contributions to the Ruby community, specifically for her work on open source projects&nbsp;<a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://nokogiri.org">Nokogiri</a>. Yoko inspired me to share an example of one of many projects that were possible thanks to free and open source software, and specifically Nokogiri.<p />In July 2011, Girl Develop It hosted a Hackathon for Humanity (in the Hamptons thanks to&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/dbdj1007">Deborah Jackson</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="http://jumpthru.net/">JumpThru</a>!),&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/nahurst">Nathan Hurst</a>&nbsp;and I used Nokogiri to parse data from&nbsp;<a href="http://backpage.com/">Backpage.com</a>&nbsp;and flag potential evidence of human trafficking. We used <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a> to pull the posts and Nokogiri to parse the data into a&nbsp;<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>&nbsp;application and&nbsp;<a href="http://postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>&nbsp;database, which I then queried to identify potential child prostitution advertisements. We were able to flag hundreds to be investigated and removed by&nbsp;<a href="http://backpage.com/">Backpage.com</a>.<p />The project readme file expands a bit on our methodology- basically, we&#8217;d read that many human trafficking rings tend to diversify their crime businesses by engaging in many types of trafficking and other illegal activity, so we cross-referenced some of the phone numbers across different subject areas on the site. We found dozens of posts that once examined by the human eye were clearly not legal, and hardly any false positives. This method proved quite accurate and a lot more manageable than manually sorting through all of the posts.<p />We definitely wouldn&#8217;t have pulled that off, especially not in a weekend hackathon, without Nokogiri being free, open source, and delightfully easy to use.<p />The project is on Github at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/girldevelopit/traffic-report">https://github.com/girldevelopit/traffic-report</a>. Note that this is the code from a one-time weekend project, but if you&#8217;re interested in forking or just learning from it and building a service to continue this work, please do! We&#8217;re happy to share any undocumented lessons or answer questions, just reach out by email (<a href="mailto:nathan@ohours.org">nathan@ohours.org</a> or <a href="mailto:vanessa@developersforgood.org">vanessa@developersforgood.org</a>).<p /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I watched&nbsp;Soledad O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s CNN <a href="http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/category/black-in-america/" target="_blank">Black in America: The New Promised Land - Silicon Valley</a> special that offered a lesser known perspective on an industry I know well. The special followed black entrepreneurs who participated in the first annual <a href="http://www.newmeaccelerator.com/" target="_blank">NewMe startup accelerator</a>. After the special aired, I watched <a href="http://www.marioarmstrong.com/on-air/innovation-nation-the-official-live-webcast/">Mario Armstrong&#8217;s Town Hall</a> and heard plenty of great advice from accomplished panelists of different races and backgrounds. In just an hour and a half they covered a range of cultural problems and shared opinions on solutions.</p>
<p>The best thing about pieces like this is that they focus on a problem and hopefully, get us all riled up to fix it - but do we? One of the audience members stood up and reminded the room that the change wasn&#8217;t going to come down from the panelists, but come up from them - that they had to make the change for themselves.</p>
<p>Right here and right now, I&#8217;d like to do something to address this problem. We heard over and over again the importance of networks and of having the right conversation with the right people. Entrepreneurs were advised to &#8220;insert&#8221; themselves into social circles of Silicon Valley. I agree with panelist/engineer/founder <a href="http://twitter.com/hankwilliams">Hank Williams</a> that taking baby steps is the key to both programming and life, so here&#8217;s my step for today:</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ll be hosting open video chats specifically to mentor people who aren&#8217;t already in my established social circles.</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="http://ohours.org/DBNess" title="My Open Mentoring Availability" target="_blank">My Open Mentoring Availability</a>, starting with</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ohours.org/officehours/3128">Thursday, November 17</a> at 1:00pm, 1:15pm, and 1:30pm ET&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://ohours.org/officehours/3130">Wednesday, November 23</a> at 2:00pm, 2:15pm, and 2:30pm ET</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to make it less uncomfortable for new people to get involved in tech and startup communities.</p>
<p>I hope to see other leaders of these communities offer their time and guidance as well. I&#8217;ve written some and talked a whole lot about personal scheduling and efficiency, so I want to be clear that this is a relatively small, effective commitment - I plan to give 45 minutes to conversations with up to three new people and to spend the remaining 15 minutes of my alotted hour following up or laying the groundwork to help those people. This will amount to roughly one hour a week. If you&#8217;d like to help, too,&nbsp;consider&nbsp;<a href="http://ohours.org/topics/mentoring">joining the Ohours mentoring topic</a>.</p>
<p>If you or anyone you know aspires to be an entrepreneur, engineer,&nbsp;teacher,&nbsp;computer scientist, wielder of data, or perhaps is now a girl scout, military brat, data lover, amateur organizational psychologist, blonde - or maybe none of the above, but would like to talk with someone who is - please send them my way. My door is <a href="http://ohours.org/DBNess">wide open</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><strong>Laziness</strong>: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<p />
<div>In keeping with Larry Wall&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="http://threevirtues.com/" target="_blank">virtues of a programmer</a>, I seek to be as lazy as possible while still&nbsp;achieving&nbsp;my goals. Working smarter, not harder, is fundamental in every program I write - shouldn&#8217;t it be fundamental in how I behave? My deepest fear is working incredibly hard on something that creates no value or helps no one at all. At the end of the day, am I tired because I changed the world, or because I developed carpal tunnel syndrome refreshing my Facebook feed?</div>
<div>
<div>
<p />
<div>I&#8217;m employed full-time at <a href="http://paperlesspost.com">Paperless Post</a>, where I work across teams on a wide variety of projects. I spend evenings and weekends running&nbsp;<a href="http://girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a>, organizing <a href="http://meetup.developersforgood.org">Developers for Good</a>, and advising <a href="http://hirelite.com">Hirelite</a>. I also exercise and watch teen dance movies of low artistic caliber regularly and eat dessert every day.</div>
<div>
<p />
<div>Simply put, I work a lot and I get a lot done. Despite that productivity, I recently found myself unable to keep up with even important emails, and on edge about relationships that might not use my time effectively. I&#8217;m familiar with techniques like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> and <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro</a>, but I hesitate to adopt any entirely new method without fully understanding what could be improved about my own.</div>
</div>
<p />
<div>So, in an effort to understand my time&#8217;s ROI, I turned to data. I tried several time-tracking tools for a couple of hours each on a Sunday while I did remote volunteer work. The free tool that was easiest to use and gave me the most freedom in analyzing my information was <a href="http://bit.ly/rBQs2s" title="Toggl.com">Toggl</a>. Thanks to web, desktop, and mobile apps, I was able to bring time tracking into all aspects of my life.</div>
<p />
<div>I have a workspace for each significant obligation in my life - e.g. Paperless Post, Girl Develop It, Developers for Good &amp; Volunteering, Personal. I use Projects to track the type of work I&#8217;m doing - e.g. Analytics, DBA, Product, Finance, Admin, Relaxation. I track&nbsp;significant&nbsp;emails or questions I answer, what I&#8217;m debugging, coding, or fixing, how long my meetings, calls, and <a href="http://ohours.org/DBNess">Ohours</a>&nbsp;take, and just about everything else.&nbsp;When I change windows on my desktop and may be off-task, the Auto-pilot Toggl app sweetly asks&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">&#8220;WTF are you doing?&#8221;</span> &#8230; &#8220;Click to change project&#8221;, making it easy to stay honest.</div>
<p />
<div>From this meticulous data collection, I&#8217;ve learned a few things about productivity:</div>
<p />
<p />
<div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">You can&#8217;t manage what you don&#8217;t measure.</span></strong></div>
<p />
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">I recently had the feeling that I was doing way too much X and not enough Y, and I was not amused. Every time an X task came up, I developed a wrinkle. After one week of time tracking, I saw I really was doing a ton of X. I felt validated. I was less emotional about the problem, and in the next week, I also gave myself freedom to delay or delegate many X tasks in pursuit of Y tasks. I&#8217;m working with my team to better manage X tasks and in the meantime, I&#8217;m more efficient and feel in control of them. I&nbsp;have irrefutable evidence about just how demanding X work is. As we try different solutions, we&#8217;ll also know exactly how much they help.</div>
<p />
<div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Good data (tracking time as you go) is extremely important.</span></strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Your planning estimates and guesses afterward will always be wrong, and good data is fundamental to any data-driven decision making. If you think you&#8217;re good at these estimates, test yourself. Then email me how hilariously wrong you were, and we&#8217;ll chuckle.</div>
<div>
<p />
<p />
<div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Tracking time increases focus and limits context switching.</strong></span></div>
<div>
<ul>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Tracking your time makes you more aware of what you&#8217;re specifically trying to accomplish, so you&#8217;re less likely to abandon one task for another.&nbsp;Maybe you only actually get to work 25 hours out of the 40 hours you&#8217;re at a work. If you need to track what you&#8217;re doing, you&#8217;ll feel compelled to make use of dead time you might have spent doing the worst kind of context switching - pretending to multitask.</div>
</div>
<p />
<div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Time is your biggest asset. Knowing where it goes benefits you more than anyone else.</span></strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">I think a strong component of this experiment&#8217;s success has been that I&#8217;m doing it for myself. I have the freedom to show others the summary or the breakdown of my time if I&#8217;d like, but this isn&#8217;t a report that goes directly to my boss or determines my paycheck. I have the freedom to be completely honest. My priority is clean, accurate data and a true reflection of how I spend time, not convincing some other person that I&#8217;m working a lot.</div>
<p />
<p />
<div>Overall, I&#8217;ve found time tracking incredibly helpful for my focus and in helping me determine which time investments are worthwhile. I&#8217;ve also noticed trends in behavior that I&#8217;ve discussed with coworkers so we can work together to boost productivity.</div>
<p />
<div>What methods do you use to get things done? How do gauge your own effectiveness? Do your methods work for both short and long-term improvement?</div>
<p />
<p />
<div><span style="font-size: small; color: #808080;"><em>Notes:</em></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small; color: #808080;"><em>One of the reasons I chose <a href="http://bit.ly/rBQs2s" title="Toggl.com">Toggl</a>&nbsp;was for their completely free basic features plan. Most other services were unpleasant to use, less functional, or only offered a 30-day free trial, which I knew from experience might not be enough time. Call me old-fashioned, but I just can&#8217;t commit to something in every aspect of my life when it&#8217;s&nbsp;guaranteed&nbsp;to dump me in a month.</em></span></div>
