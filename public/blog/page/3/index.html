  <div class="entry-content"><p>My family likes to tease me about Ceremonies - Graduations, Girl Scout or Boy Scout Awards, School Assemblies, you name it - I tear up. These pivotal points are so ripe with potential they bring me to tears every time. I can&#8217;t think of anything more beautiful than the fusion of accomplishment and raw potential for new endeavors. Earlier, you couldn&#8217;t quite justify where you were or why you were there - a credential helps with that. Later, you might not have as much time or freedom or ambition to embark on new challenges. Now is the time! Get over your years of &#8220;paying dues&#8221; and following a path because someone said it might get you where you might want to be in 5 to 10 or even 40 years and start doing what you&#8217;re made for right now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div><span style=""> </span>In the United States, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields are hurting. You know you&#8217;ve got a problem when even the government is trying to solve it (as shown by the White House&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/educate-innovate" target="_blank">Educate to Innovate</a>&nbsp;initiative&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-launches-educate-innovate-campaign-excellence-science-technology-en" target="_blank">Nov. 2009</a>)&nbsp;and private-sector CEO engagement in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.changetheequation.org/" target="_blank">Change The Equation</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2010/09/inside-change-the-equation-stem-education-initiative.html" target="_blank">Sept. 2010</a>)). Raw data clearly shows that the US awards a significantly smaller portion of science and engineering bachelor&#8217;s degrees than the majority of reporting countries (<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d09/tables/dt09_414.asp" target="_blank">NCES</a>). Within that already meek representation, computer science stands out as a dearth among dearths.</div>
<p />
<div>So techies are awesome, but we aren&#8217;t training nearly enough of them. Where could we possibly find more potential programmers??</div>
<p />
<div>The New York Times offers a classic&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2007/04/17/science/20070417_COMP_GRAPHIC.html" target="_blank">visualization of the CS gender gap</a>:</div>
<div>[[posterous-content:yBlksdjcjxmzJnxxeCCD]]</div>
<div>This visualization shows data through 2004. It has only gotten worse since then.&nbsp;In the US in 2008,&nbsp;<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d09/tables/dt09_268.asp" target="_blank">57%</a>&nbsp;of all&nbsp;bachelor&#8217;s degree recipients were female, but only&nbsp;<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d09/tables/dt09_303.asp" target="_blank">17%</a>&nbsp;of bachelor&#8217;s degrees in computer and information sciences were awarded to women.&nbsp;Oops. Looks like we found our missing programmers!</div>
<p />
<div>There are certainly plenty of underrepresented groups in computer science, but the male/female gap is by far the most severe and spans a variety of racial and socioeconomic groups, so it makes sense to address as a distinct priority.</div>
<p />
<div>As recent as a few weeks ago, a dedicated&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/28/girls-in-blech/" target="_blank">Women In Tech panel at TechCrunch Disrupt</a>&nbsp;established that everyone knows women are underrepresented in tech (especially tech startups), but left viewers wanting when it came to solutions. A few panel members noted that what we could really use is more women studying computer science or learning to program. I wholeheartedly agree.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>Software developers are awesome. More specifically:</div>
<p />
<div>Software developers make significant contributions to the community for free - both free as in beer and free as in speech - which lead to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> and similar licenses which are growing in popularity across industries. Our forums (e.g. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/faq" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>,&nbsp;and hundreds of technology-specific online user groups) are some of the most meritocratic that exist today - for the most part, positions are attacked instead of individuals. These benefits come from a base of people who genuinely understand logic (and thus can avoid silly ad hominem attacks) and who are visionaries, always sharing ideas and watching out for the next big breakthrough.</div>
<p />
<div>Software developers are exceedingly generous. We do barcamps and hackathons to address global crises ala <a href="http://crisiscommons.org/about-us/" target="_blank">CrisisCamp</a>, we help non-profits en masse through weekend pro-bono <a href="http://givecamp.org/" target="_blank">GiveCamps</a> and through groups like <a href="http://meetup.developersforgood.org" target="_blank">Developers for Good</a>. We&#8217;re addressing worldwide healthcare needs through transparent, open-source projects like <a href="http://openmrs.org/" target="_blank">OpenMRS</a> and improving local government through projects like <a href="http://civiccommons.com/" target="_blank">CivicCommons</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a>.</div>
<p />
<div>Software developers have built exceptional communities off of good ideas and a lot of hard work, but we&#8217;ve certainly never been fans of the status quo. We&#8217;re always wondering - <em>how can we get better</em>? Individual software developers improve by picking up new languages, sharing their code through GitHub, or even by creating frameworks like Rails that dramatically improve the efficiency of others. The next step in that evolution is asking as a community, <em>what can we do to collectively improve</em>? Sure, we can say that since we&#8217;re already productive it&#8217;s okay to just keep on keeping on, but that doesn&#8217;t seem true to our potential as individuals or as a community. It&#8217;s also boring. Let&#8217;s get more awesome instead.</div>
<p />
<div>Research shows that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asanet.org/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/Apr09ASRFeature.pdf">diversity is good business</a>&nbsp;[PDF]&nbsp;and <a href="http://ascc.artsci.wustl.edu/%7Eksawyer/groupgenius/excerpt.html" target="_blank">collaboration is the key to breakthrough creativity</a>, so&nbsp;<em><span style="font-size: medium;">the next great evolution of the software community is to increase diversity.&nbsp;</span></em>The true nature of our field is to seek optimization, to continually refine and improve. Broadening the range of perspectives involved in our work will fuel our ability to innovate as well as propel our economy. It will also increase the awesome.</div>
<p />
<div>
<div>It&#8217;s rational, if not empathetic, to hear the buzzword &#8220;diversity&#8221; and think - why does it matter if the ratio in programming doesn&#8217;t represent the greater population? Why more diverse, rather than just more?&nbsp;Software developers are rapidly becoming the gatekeepers for global knowledge-sharing and connectivity. Computers permeate our lives - shouldn&#8217;t the community of people who control them be as innovative and yes, as representative, as possible?</div>
<p />
<div><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_E._Allen">Fran Allen</a>,&nbsp;the first female recipient of the Turing award, summed it up quite well in an interview with Peter Seibel for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.codersatwork.com/">Coders At Work</a>,</div>
<p />
<blockquote>
<div><em>It&#8217;s such a transformative field for society as a whole. And without the involvement of a diverse group of people, the results of what we do are not going to be appealing or useful to all aspects of our society. A piece of our challenge is to make computing, and all that it enables, accessible to everyone. That&#8217;s an ideal.</em></div>
</blockquote>
<p>So, my beloved software developers - the state of our industry isn&#8217;t about yelling or blaming or terse 140 character twitfits - we are way too awesome for that. What we do have, though, is <a href="http://blog.vanessahurst.com/women-in-tech-the-opportunity">a clear opportunity to improve</a>. In order to grow and improve as an industry, we need to engage more diverse minds in software development.</p>
<p>A few ways to capitalize on this immense opportunity, and improve our field:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue above stated awesomeness by writing great code and using your skills to improve the world</li>
<li>Encourage anyone and everyone you know (and even those you don&#8217;t know) to get involved in software development</li>
<li>Mentor an aspiring developer on your next side project&nbsp;(perhaps a&nbsp;<a href="http://meetup.girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a>&nbsp;student)</li>
<li>Seek simple ways to make your work more accessible to non-expert users (e.g. add dreaded Documentation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to share constructive ideas for engaging more minds in software development in the comments or by contacting me directly.</p>

Briefly, she describes a Lack of&nbsp;Role Models, women being mentored out of technical roles, a lack of personal projects, sexism/stereotyping, differing motivations, lack of social acceptance, and wanting to fit in with other girls as influencing factors. I&#8217;ve seen these crop up in personal stores and formal research time and time again. If you&#8217;re on board with Hema, awesome - check out my my posts on Solutions: Part 1. If you&#8217;re still feeling skeptical, check out a few more references below.<p />To be thorough, formal research has shown many of the same factors Hema mentioned on Quora. Andrea Jepson and Teri Perl found that misperceptions of the field prevented girls from pursuing computer science, including a lack of role models, competing woman-specific interests, lack of industry knowledge, opportunity limitations, bad media attention, and a &ldquo;nerdy&rdquo; stereotype (<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=543826">Priming the Pipeline, 2002</a>). Sanjeev&nbsp;Arora and Bernard Chazelle allege a potential collective failure to &ldquo;articulate a cogent, compelling narrative about the science of computing (as opposed to just the technology)&rdquo; might impact women as well as men (<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/cacm05.pdf">Is the Thrill Gone?, 2005</a>&nbsp;[PDF]). Arora and Chazelle&#8217;s&nbsp;assertions are corroborated by studies by Allan Fisher and Jane Margolis at Carnegie Mellon University, where women associated computers with tools, while men perceived them as subjects worthy of study for their own sake (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=StwGQw45YoEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=unlocking+the+clubhouse+margolis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nlO5HX94tI&amp;sig=eFvhjKDTxqgG8vTU9kvan9fokKQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dfqoTM2UMYOKlweAjL2UDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Unlocking the Clubhouse, 2002</a>).<p />I&#8217;m not usually one for anecdotes over actual data, but for such a cultural perception-related, huge problem we have few good ways to deal with, I think they help our understanding a lot.&nbsp;<a href="http://valerieaurora.org/howto.html" target="_blank">Valerie Aurora&#8217;s HowTo Encouraging Women in Linux</a>&nbsp;reminds me of many elements on Hema&#8217;s Quora list,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/07/26/woman-in-technology/" target="_blank">Nicole Sullivan&#8217;s take on Code-Cowboys</a>&nbsp;and the attitudes that make programming an unattractive option to women in particular are shared widely, as are the experiences shared by women on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lealea.net/blog/comments/women-in-tech-asking-the-wrong-questions/" target="_blank">Lea Alcantara&#8217;s Women In Tech blog article</a>&nbsp;(even women who do study computer science say they left to seek&nbsp;meaningful work that they couldn&#8217;t find initially as programmers). Many women came out of the woodwork to share their stories with Michael Arrington, as well, when he asked the media to&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/28/women-in-tech-stop-blaming-me/" target="_blank">Stop Blaming Men</a>,&nbsp;<p />&nbsp;Alas, I&#8217;m a programmer and not a writer, so I don&#8217;t feel very accomplished having straightened these out. I just want it to be clear that we should be treating big problems, not just addressing anecdotal situations, and that many of the issues for women in tech are not random claims - the same themes resurface over and over again, rephrased in the light of one project or student or school or another.</div>
