Briefly, she describes a Lack of&nbsp;Role Models, women being mentored out of technical roles, a lack of personal projects, sexism/stereotyping, differing motivations, lack of social acceptance, and wanting to fit in with other girls as influencing factors. I've seen these crop up in personal stores and formal research time and time again. If you're on board with Hema, awesome - check out my my posts on Solutions: Part 1. If you're still feeling skeptical, check out a few more references below.<p />To be thorough, formal research has shown many of the same factors Hema mentioned on Quora. Andrea Jepson and Teri Perl found that misperceptions of the field prevented girls from pursuing computer science, including a lack of role models, competing woman-specific interests, lack of industry knowledge, opportunity limitations, bad media attention, and a &ldquo;nerdy&rdquo; stereotype (<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=543826">Priming the Pipeline, 2002</a>). Sanjeev&nbsp;Arora and Bernard Chazelle allege a potential collective failure to &ldquo;articulate a cogent, compelling narrative about the science of computing (as opposed to just the technology)&rdquo; might impact women as well as men (<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/cacm05.pdf">Is the Thrill Gone?, 2005</a>&nbsp;[PDF]). Arora and Chazelle's&nbsp;assertions are corroborated by studies by Allan Fisher and Jane Margolis at Carnegie Mellon University, where women associated computers with tools, while men perceived them as subjects worthy of study for their own sake (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=StwGQw45YoEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=unlocking+the+clubhouse+margolis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nlO5HX94tI&amp;sig=eFvhjKDTxqgG8vTU9kvan9fokKQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dfqoTM2UMYOKlweAjL2UDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Unlocking the Clubhouse, 2002</a>).<p />I'm not usually one for anecdotes over actual data, but for such a cultural perception-related, huge problem we have few good ways to deal with, I think they help our understanding a lot.&nbsp;<a href="http://valerieaurora.org/howto.html" target="_blank">Valerie Aurora's HowTo Encouraging Women in Linux</a>&nbsp;reminds me of many elements on Hema's Quora list,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/07/26/woman-in-technology/" target="_blank">Nicole Sullivan's take on Code-Cowboys</a>&nbsp;and the attitudes that make programming an unattractive option to women in particular are shared widely, as are the experiences shared by women on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lealea.net/blog/comments/women-in-tech-asking-the-wrong-questions/" target="_blank">Lea Alcantara's Women In Tech blog article</a>&nbsp;(even women who do study computer science say they left to seek&nbsp;meaningful work that they couldn't find initially as programmers). Many women came out of the woodwork to share their stories with Michael Arrington, as well, when he asked the media to&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/28/women-in-tech-stop-blaming-me/" target="_blank">Stop Blaming Men</a>,&nbsp;<p />&nbsp;Alas, I'm a programmer and not a writer, so I don't feel very accomplished having straightened these out. I just want it to be clear that we should be treating big problems, not just addressing anecdotal situations, and that many of the issues for women in tech are not random claims - the same themes resurface over and over again, rephrased in the light of one project or student or school or another.</div>
