<p>Circling the airport, looking at the Manhattan skyline, coming home to New York City rocks. After I've landed and gotten my Auntie Anne's high (don't JFK and LGA always smell that intoxicating buttery pretzel scent?), I rebuff a car service salesperson and the long taxi line in favor of public transportation (one of my favorite things about this city). The train is the usual diverse blend - a Chinese couple with a small child, an angry drugdealer with expensive clothes and intimidating dreadlocks yelling in to his phone, and mid-way through Brooklyn a woman boards with tall, bright purple boots and a check-me-out outfit ... and a hairnet. She proceeds to do her makeup for the next 3 stops, then fixes her hair for 2, and leaves a different person.&nbsp;<strong>That alone-in-the-crowd phenomenon is so powerful.</strong>&nbsp;I love that she felt that way. My father's judgmental voice comes in and reminds me of experiments done on monkeys in large populations in tight spaces - they get aggressive and their behavior changes, too. I prefer to think of the city as the apex of Innovation. Without us all crowding in here, how would we effectively share our ideas and impressions. How would I see those phenomenal purple boots?</p>
