  <div class="entry-content"><p>November is one of my favorite months because everyone becomes obsessed with two of my longtime favorite things: food and gratitude. If it weren&#8217;t for the creepy mustaches of <a href="http://www.movember.com/" title="Movember: the creepiest possible way to spread the word about Prostate Cancer" target="_blank">Movember</a>, November might even triumph as the best month of the year.</p>
<p>&#8216;Stache dilemma aside, I try to express gratitude regularly for three main reasons:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Acknowledgement</strong> - Life is beautiful and all of us, especially those who can read and freely share ideas through the internet, have a lot to be grateful for.</li>
    <li><strong>Happiness</strong> - It makes us happy to acknowledge the people, places, and things that make our lives better, according to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHv6vTKD6lg" title="Science of Gratitude (Video)" target="_blank">science</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Future Happiness</strong> - <span>When we know what really makes us happy (aka what we’re grateful for), we can better prioritize our lives.</span></li>
  </ol>
<p>I have a few tricks for reminding myself to express gratitude, including a thrice daily gratitude journal prompt from <a href="http://grateful160.com" title="grateful160 | Gratitude Journal" target="_blank">grateful160</a> and browsing <a href="http://www.paperlesspost.com/cards/group/stationery_thank_you_notes" title="Thank You Notes on Paperless Post" target="_blank">thank you cards on Paperless Post</a>. What works for you? Do you think gratitude is important? I&#8217;d love to hear why or why not.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yields 1 Technology-powered Social Entrepreneur<p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type: none; text-indent: 40px;">
  <li>1 Girl Scout, pre-formed by </li>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none; text-indent: 40px;">
  	  <li>1 U.S. Marine Corps Officer & Cultural Anthropologist</li>
      <li>1 Book Fair Expert & Math Lover</li>
  </ul>
  <li>1 Promise to Make the World a Better Place</li>
  <li>5 U.S. States</li>
  <li>9 Public Schools</li>
  <li>10 Girl Scout Troops</li>
  <li>1 Pre-med/Biomedical Engineering major</li>
  <li>3 Credits Computer Science 101 class</li>
  <li>1 Computer Science degree</li>
  <li>100 TB Financial Data</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<p>Mix Girl Scout, Promise, and dreams of making the world a better place in each of 5 states, 9 public schools, and 10 scout troops. After 17 years, add Pre-med/Biomedical Engineering major and Computer Science 101 class to yield Computer Science major. Four years later, add Computer Science degree and see Girl Scout grow to New York City. Add 100 TB Financial Data to establish Database Administrator expertise. Let Promise to help people at all times simmer. Girl Scout will form <a href="http://developersforgood.org">Developers for Good</a> and connect 700+ technologists with social impact organizations.</p>

<p>After years of being one of few women in the room, introduce Girl Scout to women who are interested in technology, but think it&#8217;s too late to learn to code. Girl Scout will form <a href="http://girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a> to teach low-cost, judgment-free software development courses. After three years of mixing, teaching, and organizing operations, Girl Develop It will expand to 16 chapters worldwide, over 4,000 students, and a community of 30,000 learners.</p>

<p>As the U.S. Bureau of Labor & Statistics reports we&#8217;ll have 1 million unfilled software jobs by 2018, mix Girl Scout with film producer of Waiting for Superman and other technical leaders to launch <a href="http://code.org">Code.org</a> film, &#8221;<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=nKIu9yen5nc">What most schools don&#8217;t teach</a>.&#8221; Finally, as Developers for Good and Girl Develop It and Code.org evolve, Girl Scout will produce <a href="http://codemontage.com">CodeMontage</a> to help people become better software engineers while improving the world.</p>

<h3>Results:</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type: none; text-indent: 40px;">
  <li>700 Developers for Good</li>
  <li>30,000 Girl Develop It community members</li>
  <li>16 million+ Code.org &#8220;What Most Schools Don&#8217;t Teach&#8221; views</li>
  <li>40 CodeMontage Open Source Social Impact Projects</li>
  <li>1 Social Entrepreneur, just getting started on changing the world</li>
</ul></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In typical developer style, I just spent several hours hacking on something only to find a totally different way to accomplish the same thing in about ten minutes.</p>
<p>The short version of setting up ThinkUp app was pretty phenomenally easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a free account with a free plan on <a href="http://appfog.com" title="AppFog" target="_blank">AppFog</a></li>
<li>Use Launcher.io&#8217;s <a href="https://launcher.io/ThinkUp" title="Launcher.io ThinkUp" target="_blank">ThinkUp Jumpstart one-click install</a> (golden!) to deploy to AppFog</li>
<li>Upgrade ThinkUp as prompted in your navigation bar</li>
<li>Update Settings &gt; Account &gt; Enable beta upgrades so you can get the <a href="http://blog.thinkup.com/post/39497204010/thinkup-2-0-getting-better" title="Thinkup 2.0 Beta" target="_blank">snazzy 2.0 beta</a></li>
<li>Upgrade ThinkUp as prompted in your navigation bar (again)</li>
<li>Add social media accounts in the plugins section</li>
<li>Clear your browser&#8217;s cache</li>
<li>Rock and roll</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m intrigued by ThinkUp for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/ginatrapani/thinkup" title="Think Up" target="_blank">open source</a>!</li>
<li>It has a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/thinkupapp" title="ThinkUp community" target="_blank">community that first identifies itself as friendly</a></li>
<li>It has analytics! based on data!</li>
<li>Its core codebase was written by one of my favorite developer-founders, <a href="http://ginatrapani.org/" title="Gina Trapani" target="_blank">Gina Trapani</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dashes.com" title="Anil Dash" target="_blank">Anil Dash</a>,&nbsp;Gina&#8217;s co-founder,&nbsp;is one of the best twitter users I know (seriously, did you see <a href="http://twitter.com/anildash/status/275055322102636544" title="High Five Fist Bump" target="_blank">this tweet</a>?)</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><em>What hiring managers look for in a candidate, and how you can show them what they want to see</em>. Originally published on <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/07/how-to-get-hired-as-a-professional-developer">Skillcrush</a>.

<div class="entry-content">
  </br>
  <p>I’m going to come right out and say it &#8211; coders are better than superheroes. To me, software development is a magical, efficient way to improve the human experience. Thus, I’ve spent my professional life focused on software.</p>
  <p>Most recently, I recruited software development instructors for <a href="http://girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a> and helped build the engineering team at <a href="http://paperlesspost.com/">Paperless Post</a>. Previously, I did college recruiting, hiring, and training for a financial data provider. I’m also an advisor to speed-dating-for-software-jobs startup <a href="http://hirelite.com/">Hirelite</a>. In total, I’ve met, recruited, resume-screened, phone-screened, skype-screened, and face-to-face interviewed hundreds of aspiring developers.</p>
  <p>One of the best things you can do to get hired in any field is to think like a hiring manager. Make their job easy by presenting your background and skills in light of the job they’re hiring for. If they’re looking for an iOS developer, focus on your iOS projects, even if you’ve spent a lot of time doing other cool things. Your resume needn’t be a history of your entire life, nor include everything you know &#8211; it’s a chance to showcase that you can do the job, and a way to earn face time with the company.</p>
  <p>You’re out to prove that you are relevant to the position, competent, and interesting enough that the hiring manager is excited to talk further. Being relevant and interesting are a matter of packaging and perspective &#8211; competent, however, takes a little bit more.</p>
  <p>Here are five signs of competence great hiring managers look for:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Are you smart?</strong><br />
  Okay, obviously everyone wants to work with smart people. The best hiring managers are, to boot, looking for someone smarter than they are. The idea that software engineering is a matter of straightforward implementation (often compared to building construction) is a myth. Software is intricate and hard and requires smart, conscientious craftspeople to bring it to life.</p>
  <p>Show you are smart by getting the details right (e.g. fix typos in your resume, keep track of information you’re given during the interview process). Smart is the convergence of intelligence and behavior &#8211; you can be a genius, but if you can’t focus long enough to tell me about your breakthroughs, you’re not acting smart. At the resume stage, good grades and good schools can be proxies for smartness, so feel free to add them, but don’t worry if they don’t represent you at your best &#8211; find what does, and showcase that.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Do you get things done?</strong><br />
  As Joel Spolsky put it, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/06/05.html">“People who are smart but don’t get things done&#8230;would rather mull over something academic about a problem rather than ship on time.”</a> The need to get things done is the reason &#8211; really, the only reason &#8211; we’re hiring. Getting things done is a must.</p>
  <p>Show you have a track record of accomplishing things &#8211; regardless of whether they’re even code-related. What have you shipped? When have you demonstrated leadership? Remember that some of the best leadership is demonstrated without authority. A willingness to make a path where there isn’t one, to solve a problem and hop <a href="http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trsorbonnespeech.html">in the arena</a>, to not always wait for permission before beginning important work, is extremely valuable. If you get things done, shout it from the rooftops! <em>We want to hire you.</em></p>
  <p><strong>3. Do you solve “hard” problems?</strong><br />
  Learning to code is no small feat, but software developers are responsible for more than just writing code. “Hard” in this case describes problems that have no clear solution and haven’t been solved before. Coding your own blog from scratch is not a hard problem in this sense &#8211; it has been done before and there’s plenty of documentation to explain how to do it again. It’s a worthy learning exercise, but it’s just not the same as a real-live project with unpredictable requirements, unanticipated technology incompatibilities, stakeholder meltdowns, warts, and all.</p>
  <p>Show you’ve worked outside the box and still succeeded. The best way to do this is to build or improve an open-source software application that has users and stakeholders. <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> is a great way to showcase this kind of work, and captures your work with other people far better than private code samples can. The next best way is to showcase the technical problems you have solved, no matter how hard, and also the hard problems you have solved, regardless of how technical.</p>
  <p>Wrote a short custom script that saves you and coworkers a few hours a month? Ran a large conference? Started an event series? Researched for a thesis? <em>We want to hire you.</em></p>
  <p><strong>4. Can you explain your solution?</strong><br />
  “Communication skills” does not mean “is able to speak.” It means “can say something important in a way that others digest.” The most valuable team members are the ones who not only get things done well, but who expand their impact by communicating what they did to the rest of the team. Developers who share lessons learned, teach others, and document how and why they make decisions are much more valuable (and often more enjoyable to work with) than those who work in a vacuum.</p>
  <p>Show your blog, the documentation you’ve written, articles you’ve published, talks you’ve given, even your twitter stream &#8211; anything that shows you’re sharing what you’ve learned with others. Your blog can be a simple as “I tried to install the Heroku gem on Ruby 1.9.3 and it broke, so I switched back to Ruby 1.9.2 and it worked like a charm” and some one else on the Internet will feel less lonely when they experience the same thing. The only thing worse than an unsolved problem is a problem solved by a person who can’t tell you how the solution works. Show us that you won’t be that person. <em>We want to hire you.</em></p>
  <p><strong>5. Are you passionate?</strong><br />
  Great developers must be passionate to make and/or change things. Even the best corporate incentive structure can’t replace a person who, upon seeing a problem, is naturally compelled to fix it. This is the engineer’s equivalent of scientific curiosity, and it manifests in all sorts of ways. For example, making movies counts, watching movies does not, creating or mixing music counts, attending concerts does not. In startups especially, everything is some shade of broken. There’s just no room for people who don’t improve without being told to do so.</p>
  <p>Show whatever you’re passionate about. Get involved with communities and projects that address what makes you angry, or promote what makes you happy. Attend developer meetups and hackathons when you can, and engage with online communities if those don’t fit your schedule. Your passion doesn’t have to be coding itself &#8211; it can be better communication, education, healthcare, banking &#8211; whatever you feel called to fix in the world. Showing that you’re driven by something other than your manager showing up at your desk every few hours is powerful. <em>We want to hire you.</em></p>
  <p><strong>This all sounds great, but I am just a beginning developer. Where can I find hard problems to solve?</strong><br />
  In my experience recruiting developers and training beginners, I’ve found that solving hard problems has been by far the most difficult trait to find in aspiring developers, especially early in their software careers. I founded <a href="http://codemontage.com/">CodeMontage</a> to fix this problem, by helping developers get meaningful experience through contributions to open source, social good projects. We help coders find projects with causes and technologies they care about, challenges that build their skills and move the project forward, and code reviews and feedback on the quality and structure of their code.</p>
  <p>CodeMontage is how coders improve their skills while improving the world. If you have dabbled in some online or offline coding classes, but now need to build up a portfolio of hard problems that you’ve successfully solved, <a href="http://codemontage.com/">join us</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>They say when you find the right person you just <em>know</em>.</p>
<p>Why do we embrace this notion for love and friend relationships, but create our most pivotal career relationships from job titles or at best, text-based inventories of skills? Mentoring is about so much more than a discrete transfer of skills - it&#8217;s about sharing the real failures and successes we inevitably encounter in our professional lives.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m grateful to have mentored as a technical lead, founder, and girl scout. I&#8217;ve had excellent short and long-term mentors and I&#8217;ve also connected with &#8220;mentors&#8221; who I wasn&#8217;t sure what to talk about with next. I&#8217;ve seen mentoring relationships between people of all ages and from casual to corporate environments and noticed a few common factors of success.</p>
<div>All relationships need a strong foundation, and mentoring is no different. The key components of a strong mentoring pair are:<em>&nbsp;</em></div>
<p><strong>Chemistry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have to straight up like each other.&nbsp;Mentors must genuinely care about their mentees as individuals so they will share time and experiences openly, without resentment.&nbsp;Mentees must feel a strong enough connection to overcome the discomfort of asking tough questions and to internalize the mentor&#8217;s advice.</li>
<li>Corporate mentoring programs tend to match purely based on divisions or job ranks, and their programs are valuable for networking, but rarely as effective as matches with an emotional bond.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shared Values</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing similar life values makes it more likely you&#8217;ll be comfortable with similar tactics for dealing with problems, and that you&#8217;ll both listen to each other.<br /> <span style=""> </span>For example - I believe strongly in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_culture_movement" target="_blank"><span>free culture movement</span></a>. It would be hard for me to take the advice of a technical mentor who believed in technology that strongly limits use in order to protect copyright holders, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management" target="_blank"><span>DRM</span></a>. Without a strong basis of shared values, the depth of our relationship and ability to explore solutions together would be limited. I also might snarl at them, which could compromise our chemistry.</li>
<li>Communities (vs. corporations) often spawn excellent mentoring relationships, even if they don&#8217;t deliberately facilitate, because of the strength of shared values among members.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transparent Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both mentors and mentees must articulate and share their goals. Otherwise, you&#8217;re just hanging out.</li>
<li>At the end of a session, and routinely during the active mentoring relationship, both sides should be able to ask &#8220;did you get what you hoped for out of this?&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve developed a relationship with someone you can learn from or share your knowledge with, the details of when, how, and how often suddenly don&#8217;t seem like such a chore. You&#8217;ll be free to focus on sharing and improving through mentorship.</p>
