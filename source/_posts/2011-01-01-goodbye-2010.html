<p>Dear 2010,</p>
<p>You almost got me down with these health problems, but even so</p>
<p>1) <a href="http://www.developersforgood.org">Developers for Good</a> has directly connected dozens of programmers with awesome volunteer opportunities in NYC,<br /> 2) <a href="http://www.hirelite.com">Hirelite</a> has placed dozens of software engineers with great jobs in NYC through efficient video interviews,<br /> 3)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.girldevelopit.org">Girl Develop It</a> has created a community of over 600 women, including 200+ students, who are psyched about software development,<br /> 4) <a href="http://xkcd.com/828">xkcd</a> helped me stay geeky and stay positive,<br /> and<br /> 5) I am going to change the world anyway.</p>
<p>Bring it on, 2011!</p>
