While there are a number of <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/download" target="_blank">one-click installs</a> and <a href="http://postgresapp.com" target="_blank">fancy new ways</a> to get the world&#39;s best open source relational database (PostgreSQL, of course ;)) set up nowadays, nothing is easier than not even installing.<p /><div>Enter Heroku Postgres dev plans: Free Postgres 9.1 in the cloud. WOOHOOOO!</div><p /><div>I&#39;ve been hoping for ways to teach people the wonder that is SQL without limiting the class to linux hackers and it&#39;s been quite a drag. Finally, an easy way to use Postgres without having to become a DBA first...</div> <p /><div>Create your very own Postgres database: <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/" target="_blank">https://postgres.heroku.com</a> (Choose the Dev (free) plan to get started)</div><p /><div>Install pgAdmin III or your choice of SQL admin tool: <a href="http://pgadmin.org/download/" target="_blank">http://pgadmin.org/download</a><br /> <p /><div>Use pgAdmin to connect to your database:</div><div><ol><li>File &gt; Add Server. In &quot;New Server Registration&quot;, fill in the following:</li></ol><ol><li>Name - [heroku_app] (this is for your own reference)</li> <li>Host - [ec2_host] (this tells pgAdmin which computer to connect to via the internet as is often an IP address)</li><li>Maintenance DB - [db_name] (this will most likely be postgres on your own servers / other non-Heroku setups)</li> <li>User - [db_user]</li><li>Password - [db_password]</li><li>check Save password (do NOT do this on a shared computer, but on your own since we&#39;re not using sensitive information this is okay)<p /></li></ol><li>Navigate to the Advanced tab in &quot;New Server Registration&quot;</li> <ol><li>In &quot;DB Restrictions&quot;, enter &#39;[db_name]&#39; (include the single quotes. this limits how many Heroku databases you see that you can&#39;t connect to and makes life simpler by avoiding random rejection messages while navigating pgAdmin)</li> </ol></div><div>If you&#39;re in NYC, check out my Skillshare class <a href="http://skl.sh/MhFHWB" target="_blank">Intro to SQL for Data Analysis</a> where we&#39;ll use Postgres to analyze data from DonorsChoose.org and see if we can hack education together!</div> <p /> </div>
